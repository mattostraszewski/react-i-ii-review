  this.props.nameOfProp

4.  How do you access props from a functional component?
  Must pass props as parameter in the function.

5.  How do you bind a function to a parent component so that it can be passed to a child?
  Make function an arrow function to automatically bind it.

### Understand

Discuss this question in pairs if you have a 4-person group

6.  What's happening in this component?

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";

class Queue extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      questions: []
    };

    this.askQuestion = this.askQuestion.bind(this);
    this.answerQuestion = this.answerQuestion.bind(this);
  }
  askQuestion(newQuestion) {
    const questions = [...this.state.questions, newQuestion];
    this.setState({ questions });
  }
  answerQuestion(index) {
    const questions = [...this.state.questions];
    questions.splice(index, 1);
    this.setState({ questions });
  }
  render() {
    <div className="queue-container">
      <h1>The Queue</h1>
      <h3>{this.state.questions.length}</h3>
      <h3>questions need answers</h3>
      <Student askQuestion={this.askQuestion} />
      <Mentor answerQuestion={this.answerQuestion} />
    </div>;
  }
}
```

### Apply

Try these on your own, but work together if you start to get stuck.

7.  Using the `Queue` component above, create a `Student` component that can add a question as a string and a `Mentor` component that can remove a question from the array.

### Analyze, Evaluate, Create

Discuss these questions as a group

8.  In the Queue component above, why are we holding state in the Queue component instead of Mentor or Student?
